## Data Summary

| Variable         | Type              | Unit   | Data Source   |
|------------------|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| Total Point/Rank | Dependent         | Point (mean = 0) | -          |
| Volume (1M)      | Independent       | USD    | Defillama     |
| TVL              | Independent       | USD    | Defillama     |
| Cumulative Volume| Independent       | USD    | Defillama     |
| Fees (30D)       | Independent       | USD    | Defillama     |

## Correlation Analysis
![Cluster Visualization](figure/corr.png)

- Volume, TVL, and Cumulative Volume have a very strong correlation with the Total Point (coefficient 0.98‚Äì0.99). ‚Üí These are the key factors determining the ranking of the DEX.
- Multi-chain has a strong correlation with Total Point (0.86), Volume (0.84), and TVL (0.84). ‚Üí The ability to support multiple blockchains helps increase liquidity and expand the market.
- Fees have a weak correlation with Total Point (0.64) and almost no correlation with TVL (0.32) or Multi-chain (0.30) ‚Üí It is reasonable to exclude Fees from the ranking model as it does not contribute significantly to the Total Point.


## Z-score and Total Point Calculation

**Formula:** Total Point = (Volume * 40%) + (TVL * 30%) + (Cumulative Volume * 20%) + (Multi-chain * 10%)


**Top 3 DEXs:**

| Rank | DEX         | Total Point |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Uniswap**  | 2.2662      |
| 2 | PancakeSwap | 1.1264      |
| 3 | Raydium     | -0.1042     |


![Cluster Visualization](figure/cof.png)
- Only 2 out of 10 DEXs achieved a Total Point ‚â•1.0, with Uniswap taking a clear lead (2.26), followed by PancakeSwap with 1.1264 points. These two DEXs are also the dominant exchanges in the market with a significant ability to attract volume

|-------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Airdrop     | ‚úÖ Rare, impactful (e.g., 2020 event)   | ‚úÖ Frequent, through events/programs         | Only early stage                 |
| Campaigns   | Few                                    | Many, multi-platform                        | Moderate                           |

**Uniswap**
- Advantage: While large airdrop events are rare, they create a significant impact on the DeFi ecosystem. Few marketing campaigns, but strong community support.\
‚û°Ô∏èThe communication advantage stems from the brand's early positioning and the impactful innovations in technology.
**Pancake**
- Advantage: Continuous strategy to attract and retain users through airdrop events, with programs that appeal to younger users and newcomers.\
‚û°Ô∏èThe communication advantage lies in the proactive and diverse methods of customer retention through rewards.
**Raydium**
- Advantage: Airdrop campaigns, although implemented only in the early stages, created a momentum that attracted a large portion of Solana users.\
‚û°Ô∏èThe communication advantage lies in the focus on the Solana ecosystem, complementing the benefits of speed and low slippage.

## UX Issue 1:
For new users, after clicking the Supply button for a token, two options appear simultaneously: **"Approve"** and **"Supply [USDT]** (disabled)".\
The interface displays the Supply button even when the Approve step hasn't been completed, which can be confusing.
This causes users to expect they can supply immediately, but then they get stuck.\
‚û°Ô∏è Users may drop off right at this step.\

![Cluster Visualization](figure/issue1.png)
##Issue 2: Waiting time when performing ‚ÄúSupply‚Äù takes around 1‚Äì2 minutes (e.g. supplying USDT on Polygon network).\
This is technically normal since the waiting time depends on the chain. However, it can frustrate new users ‚Üí they may leave in the middle of the process\
‚û°Ô∏è(1) Users cancel the transaction and leave\
‚û°Ô∏è(2) The platform continues to process while users start another transaction ‚Üí leads to wasted gas for users.
